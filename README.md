Watch National Finals Rodeo (NFR) 2024 All Events Incuding “Super Bowl of rodeo” Live Stream Online From Anywhere. No cable or VPN required. One Time Payment, No Hidden Fees.

The Cowboy Channel is the place to watch the 2024 National Finals Rodeo in the U.S. As well as being available to watch on a variety of cable packages, The Cowboy Channel is also carried by several OTT streaming services. For example, it’s included in DirecTV’s Ultimate and Premier packages, costing $115/month and $160/month respectively.

If the National Finals Rodeo is the Super Bowl of rodeo, the All-Around title is the Vince Lombardi Trophy, and for the first time since 2019, it’s guaranteed to change hands this year. Five-time back-to-back champion Stetson Wright is still recovering from an injury he sustained at last year’s event, which has blown the competition wide open.

For 10 nights, the 66th Wrangler NFR takes over the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas for the climax of the professional rodeo season.

It’s Tie-Down Roping stand-out Shad Mayfield who enters the finals atop the All-Around standings, though with Wright expected to return to competition next year, the Bull Riding rookie Wacey Schalla and 2016 All-Around champion and Team Roping specialist Junior Nogueira also have a rare chance to be amongst the favourites.

A number of contenders are peaking just at the right time, most notably Bareback Riding’s Jess Pope, and Barrel Racing’s Hailey Kinsel, while Damian Brennan and Mayfield have near-insurmountable leads in Saddle Bronc Riding and Tie-Down Roping, respectively.

The Steer Wrestling competition has real feel-good potential, with perennial nearly-men Dakota Eldridge and Will Lummus hoping to do enough to reel in hot-shot Dalton Massey and fend off the reigning five-time champion Tyler Waguespack as he eases his way back after injury.

Witness the surge of popularity in experiencing the NFR live stream through a modern lens — social media. This avenue revolves around individuals utilizing their trusty mobile devices to seamlessly transmit the event live to their chosen social media platforms. As the anticipation escalates, these platforms rise to the forefront:
